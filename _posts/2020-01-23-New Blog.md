I have this one habit, to analyse something and forget about it. I may have write it somewhere or keep in excel file but it was not the same. It's not that easy to get back to understand what I have written and analyse before. Thus, I make this blog. In this blog, I will compile all my analysis and explain as much as possible, that even someone else reading it will understand what it is about. 

Here, I will focus on fundamental analysis, maybe like 80% of the time, which happens to be my style of investing for last couple of years. I enjoy doing nothing instead of worrying much looking at the Mr Market, as Benjamin Graham would call it.
