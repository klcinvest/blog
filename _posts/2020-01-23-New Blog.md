I have this one habit, to analyse something and forget about it. I may have write it somewhere or keep in excel file but it was not the same. It's not that easy to get back to understand what I have written and analyse before. Thus, I make this blog. In this blog, I will compile all my analysis and explain as much as possible, that even someone else reading it will understand what it is about. 

Here, I will focus on fundamental analysis, maybe like 80% of the time, which happens to be my style of investing for last couple of years. I enjoy doing nothing instead of worrying much looking at the Mr Market, as Benjamin Graham would call it.

As it is still in the first month of 2020, I spent sometime testing my hypothesis, does business with good fundamental gives good return over 5 to 10 years in last decade. If it is true, then I believe my action of doing nothing is actually a good thing. Well, by doing nothing I mean just spent few days or weeks to understand the business and once in a while revisit the counter just to be sure we are in good track.

These are 15 counters I believe has the best fundamentals in KLCI. Or at least those are the few I analysed. Short comment, I
