title: Fundamental Not Dead - tested with KLCI
---
We began experimenting with data for last decade (2010-2019) to test hypothesis which have been widely accepted. Does fundamental analysis sufficient to provide good return over long term, at least 10 year period. Although this has been proved in many cases, but as we checked there are no sources mentioning whether FBMKLCI gives similar result. Hence this analysis.

These are 15 counters which we believe has the strongest fundamentals in KLCI. Or at least those are the few I analysed. For study purpose, I include all companies including non-shariah counters.

Over 10 years, total return can go up to 353% and the lowest is 16.9%. To give better insight to the ROI per year, we used Annualized Return over calculated years. The average annualized 10 years return gives 16% for all 14 counters (INARI excluded as they went public in less than 10 years). 7 years annualized return averaged to 21.9%.

For some traders, this figure might not seems attractive. But as a value investor, we enjoy doing less things and get comparably good return.
